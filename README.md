# Sysbot-Status
A custom Python Discord Bot script that will detect when a sysbot is online/offline.  

# *****__Bot Online/Offline Tracker:__*****
----------------------------------------------

Are you tired of changing your Sysbot's channel status between ✅ and ❌? This is the bot for you!

**Step 1) Bot Requirements**

- You must have a tradebot and a log channel for that bot for Sysbot Status Patrol to function correctly. Contact your bot developer and ask for a log channel made for this purpose. 

Example:  
Sv-TradeBot (Channel 1 where trades go through)
Sv-TradeBot Logs (Channel 2 where the bot logs everything)

## --------------------------------

**Step 2) Linking your Channels**

Input the command !logchannel followed by the bot's log channel and then the trade request channel you want changed from ❌ to ✅. This will allow Sysbot Status Patrol to change the channel's icon. *****Make sure to give this bot perms to manage the channel you want changed or it won't work!*****

Example:  `!logchannel #Sv-TradeBot-Logs #Sv-TradeBot`
